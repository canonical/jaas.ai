        <h3 class="p-heading--four">What is Juju?</h3>
        <p>
          Juju is an open source application modelling tool that allows you
          to deploy, configure, scale and operate cloud infrastructures
          quickly and efficiently on public clouds such as AWS, GCE, and
          Azure along with private ones such as MAAS, OpenStack, and VSphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its store allows access to a wide range of best practice solutions
          which you can deploy with a single command. You can use Juju from
          the command line or through its powerful graphical representation
          of the model in the GUI.
        </p>

        <h4>What is JAAS?</h4>
        <p>
          JAAS is Juju as a Service, managed by Canonical, the makers of
          Ubuntu. It introduces a common controller that operates all the
          machines in your running models.
        </p>
        <p>
          JAAS enables you to quickly build, configure, manage and deploy
          your applications to the public cloud directly from your browser
          or the command line. It also allows you to share your models and
          easily collaborate with other users.

      <div>
        <h4>What is the difference between Juju and JAAS?</h4>
        <p>
          Juju as a Service (JAAS) is a hosted service for using Juju to
          operate your applications. JAAS is the fastest way to operate your
          workloads on supported clouds with the fewest instances required.
          You can use JAAS alongside your other self-hosted Juju
          infrastructure with the same CLI and GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Juju is a full release. JAAS is currently in public beta.

      <div>
        <h4>What are charms?</h4>
        <p>
          Charms are collections of scripts that contain all the operations
          necessary to deploy, configure, scale, and maintain cloud
          applications easily with Juju. Charms encapsulate a single
          application and all the code and know-how it takes to operate it,
          such as how to combine and work with other related applications or
          how to upgrade it.

          </a>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>How do I know charms are safe to use?</h4>
        <p>
          Charms deployed from the charm store are community vetted and open
          source (even though the software they encapsulate may not be).
        </p>
        <p>
          &lsquo;Recommended&rsquo; charms have also met additional criteria
          and have been vetted by the Juju Charmers team.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Are Juju and JAAS free to use?</h4>
        <p>
          Juju is free to use. It is an open source application that you
          install on your own hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          JAAS is a hosted service. During the beta period, it is free to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will incur a separate fee from your cloud provider for any
          resources used. Calculators for

      <div>
        <h4>What are bundles?</h4>
        <p>
          Bundles are ready-to-run collections of applications which have
          been modelled to work together &mdash; this can include particular
          configurations and relations between the software to be deployed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bundles may also be optimised for different deployment scenarios
          of the same software &mdash; for example, a scale-out production
          ready version like <a href="https://charmhub.io/charmed-kubernetes">Charmed
          Kubernetes</a>, or a development friendly test
          version like <a href="https://charmhub.io/kubernetes-core">Kubernetes Core</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>What is application modelling?</h4>
        <p>
          Application modelling is a simple way of describing what software
          should actually do, specified from the top down (services and how
          they relate) rather than built from the bottom up, making for a
          clean and portable expression of intent rather than a complicated
          recipe. Juju delivers the tools to describe your model and then to
          turn it into reality in a repeatable fashion on any cloud or
          computing resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the operational hard work is automated, connecting your
          services so they can work together and provision the
          appropriate machines. You can scale up, scale down, or even
          re-deploy the same model on another cloud.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>How does it compare to Puppet and Chef?</h4>
        <p>Puppet and Chef are great tools for configuration management.</p>
        <p>
          Juju provides a higher level of abstraction, supplying the tools
          to manage the full scope of operations beyond deployment and
          configuration management, regardless of the machine on which it
          runs.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main advantages of Juju is its dynamic configuration
          ability, which allows you to re-configure services on the fly,
          add, remove, or change relationships between services, and scale
          in or out with ease, sharing the operational knowledge and making
          the most of the wider community.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>What kind of applications can I deploy?</h4>
        <p>
          Charms are available for hundreds of common and popular
          cloud-oriented applications such as Kubernetes, Apache Hadoop,
          Big Data solutions, OpenStack, or even your own software, with new
          ones being added every day.

          Yes! You can integrate your existing Chef, Puppet, Docker or other
          scripts with custom charms for your own use, or make use of the
          Juju store and the existing ecosystem of charm developers to
          package and promote your application to a wider audience. There are

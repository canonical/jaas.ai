# jaas.ai

[![Code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/canonical/jaas.ai/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/canonical/jaas.ai)

A prototype for what may become the new JAAS storefront, jaas.ai.

## Local Development

The simplest way to run the site locally is using the [`dotrun`](https://github.com/canonical/dotrun/) snap. Please use the installation scripts [mentioned in the README](https://github.com/canonical/dotrun/blob/main/README.md#installation) to install `dotrun`.

Once it's installed, run the project with:

```bash
dotrun
```

Once the server has started, you can visit <http://127.0.0.1:8029> in your browser. That's it!
